                    nullable: false
                  remarks: Internal integer identifier for the navaid. This will stay persistent, even if the navaid identifier or frequency changes.

              - column:
                  name: filename
                  type: char(64)
                  constraints:
                    nullable: false
                  remarks: This is a unique string identifier constructed from the navaid name and country, and used in the OurAirports URL.
              - column:
                  name: ident
                  type: char(8)
                  constraints:
                    nullable: false
                  remarks: The 1-3 character identifer that the navaid transmits.

              - column:
                  name: name
                  type: char(32)
                  remarks: The name of the navaid, excluding its type.
              - column:
                  name: type
                  type: char(7)
                  constraints:
                    nullable: false
                  remarks: The type of the navaid. Options are "DME", "NDB", "NDB-DME", "TACAN", "VOR", "VOR-DME", or "VORTAC". See the map legend for more information about each type.
              - column:
                  name: frequency_khz
                  type: integer
                  constraints:
                    nullable: false
                  remarks: The frequency of the navaid in kilohertz. If the Navaid operates on the VHF band (VOR, VOR-DME) or operates on the UHF band with a paired VHF frequency (DME, TACAN, VORTAC), the you need to divide this number by 1,000 to get the frequency in megahertz (115.3 MHz in this example). For an NDB or NDB-DME, you can use this frequency directly.

                  type: decimal(10,6)
                  remarks: The latitude of the associated DME in decimal degrees (negative for south). If missing, assume that the value is the same as latitude_deg.

                  type: decimal(6,2)
                  remarks: The magnetic variation adjustment built into a VOR''s, VOR-DME''s, or TACAN''s radials. Positive means east (added to the true direction), and negative means west (subtracted from the true direction). This will not usually be the same as magnetic-variation because the magnetic pole is constantly in motion.
              - column:
                  name: magnetic_variation_deg
                  type: decimal(6,3)
